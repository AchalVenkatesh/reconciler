# Reconciler
A simple reconciler which updates the DOM in real time, written in VanillaJS.
I know, ReactJS does it in a single line, but I like the Vanilla baby :full_moon_with_face:😏

## Getting Started
Ok, so you actually want to see if it works? Ok, fine then.

#### Step 1:
Create a directory named reconciler and cd into it
```bash
mkdir reconciler
cd reconciler
```
#### Step 2:
Clone the repo into the directory 
```git
git clone https://github.com/AchalVenkatesh/reconciler.git
```
#### Step 3:
cd into server and install npm, express and cors
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm i express
npm i cors
```
#### Step 4:
Open it in your favourite text editor and check it out yourself, make changes, do whatever the hell you want(🔫 Use Vim)
